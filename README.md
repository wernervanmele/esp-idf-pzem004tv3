# PZEM-004T v3.0 ESP-IDF Library  
Basically a copy/paste from Jakub Mandula's excellent Arduino Library: https://github.com/mandulaj/PZEM-004T-v30 and added some ESP-IDF sauce.  


 **What works ?**  
- All measurements.
- Reset energy counter.  
  
  

 **Not Tested/Implemented**  
- Change the device address.  

Tested on ESP-IDF Framework v5.0.2  
Only tested on ESP32-WROOM Chip (mainly the MH-ET Live MiniKit v2.0).  
Tried wihtout luck with a Wemos Lolin D32 S3 Mini.  
  
**How to use it ?**  
Copy all *.c and *.h files in the same folder as your main.c file.  
Check the example for basic usage.
